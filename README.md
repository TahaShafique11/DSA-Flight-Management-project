The Flight Management System (FMS) is a robust program designed to optimize flight routes, schedules, and costs between cities. It utilizes a graph-based data structure to represent cities as nodes and flight routes as weighted edges, with Dijkstra's Algorithm implemented to find the shortest and most economical paths. Additionally, Binary Search Trees (BSTs) are used to store and efficiently search flight schedules based on user-specified times. The system features separate menus for administrators (to manage cities, routes, and flight times) and users (to search for flights and view schedules), providing an efficient, scalable, and user-friendly solution for flight management.
